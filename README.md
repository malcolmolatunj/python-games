# Python-games

Games created in Python, intended to run in the terminal.

## Installation

Most games use packages from Python's standard library. However, the sudoku solver uses the 3rd-party library "Numpy,"
which you can install using the command below in your terminal.
```bash
  pip install numpy
```
